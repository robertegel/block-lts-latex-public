\subsection{1D Dam Break} 

\subsubsection{Accuracy} \label{sec:results-accuracy-analytical}

The \gls{1D} dam break was used for validating the implemented \gls{frozen-block-LTS} scheme.
\autoref{fig:acc-fo} and \autoref{fig:acc-tvd} show water depth and velocity profiles for both wet and dry dam break cases at time $t=\SI{0.6}{\second}$ using first-order and \gls{tvd} reconstruction, respectively.
\gls{gts} values are represented by circle marks,
\gls{lts} values are shown as cross marks,
and the analytical solution is drawn as a solid black line.
% Since
Visually, no differences between the numerical results can be identified.
% A visual analysis does not show any differences between values obtained through \gls{gts} and \gls{lts}, as both marks align perfectly in all cases. 
This applies to both first-order and \gls{tvd} reconstruction.

\autoref{tab:nse-accuracy} contains \gls{nse} results of the \gls{1D} dam break.
Similarly to the plots, they do not indicate a loss of accuracy through the use of the \gls{lts} scheme.
For both water depth and velocity using \gls{tvd} reconstruction, as well as water depth with first-order reconstruction,
the first six decimal places 
% of the \gls{nse} 
are identical between the \gls{gts} and \gls{lts} schemes.
Only the \gls{nse} for the velocity in the case of first-order reconstruction exhibits any difference between the time-stepping schemes:
In the wet case, the difference is only \num{1e-6}, while the largest difference in \gls{nse} is observed in the dry case, where it amounts to $<\num{2e-4}$. Both can be considered negligible.
% For \gls{tvd} reconstruction, the \gls{nse} does not differ between \gls{gts} and \gls{lts} solutions at all until the sixth decimal place.
% For the first-order reconstruction scheme, there are no differences in the water depth's \gls{nse}.
% Although the velocity's \gls{nse} differs slightly for both cases, for the wet case, it is by just $\num{1e-6}$, and for the dry case by $\num{1.73e-4}$; both can be considered negligible.

However, in the wet dam break cases, only \SI{0.22}{\percent} of all flux updates are scalar computations.
This is due to the small cell sizes of this scenario, see \autoref{sec:results-benchmarks}.
Therefore, the relevance of this test configuration, as well as its results, may be questioned.
The impact of cell size is further analyzed in \autoref{sec:results-benchmarks}.
The heatmaps below the water depth and velocity profiles illustrate the \gls{ssc}:
lighter colors indicate a lighter load, i.e., a higher \acrlong{ssc}, while darker colors denote more full flux computations.
% light blocks are often updated using scalar flux computations, dark blocks used full flux computations for all updates.

\subsubsection{Runtime Analysis}\label{sec:results-benchmarks}

In the dam break cases for runtime benchmarks, a collection of variants has been introduced, see \autoref{sec:case-dambreak}.
Every variant has been run 25 times for each combination of \gls{gts}/\gls{lts} first-order/\gls{tvd} reconstruction.
\autoref{tab:benchmarks} lists the average runtime of these runs, the relative difference between \gls{gts} and \gls{lts} runtimes as \gls{rtr} and \acrfull{ssc}.
Variations were considered negligible, as standard deviations are $< \SI{1}{\percent}$ of the average values for all configurations, except for the reduced block size of $8 \times 8$ cells, where it amounts to $\sim\!\SI{2}{\percent}$.

The base configuration shows that runtime can be reduced by \SI{10.09}{\percent} through \gls{lts} for first-order and by \SI{12.05}{\percent} for \gls{tvd} reconstruction.
Other configurations have shown both higher and lower reduction values.
While decreasing block size from $64 \times 64$ to $32 \times 32$ showed an increased reduction, setting it to $8 \times 8$ and $128 \times 128$ showed a decrease in runtime reduction.
This indicates that there is an optimal value for this parameter for the use of \gls{frozen-block-LTS} somewhere between $8 \times 8$ and $64 \times 64$, possibly, close to $32 \times 32$.

Mesh size has a minor impact on the runtime reduction.
The slight improvement when using the larger mesh might be due to a longer runtime in general, which reduces the portion of initialization time over the \gls{lts}-adjusted time loop.
An increase of the simulation's duration has a similar effect 
on the effectivity of \gls{lts}, most likely for the same reason.

% Adjustments to cell size $l_x$ and $l_y$ show that runtime reduction increases with cell size.
% This is due to the direct effect of cell area and perimeter on the local time step.
% Assuming $l_x = l_y$, $\Delta t_i$ is proportional to $l_x$ (\autoref{eq:local-time-step}).
% From this, we may conclude that
% larger time steps seem to benefit \gls{lts}.
% The same explanation is valid for varying the Courant number, as it is proportional to $\Delta t_i$ as well (\autoref{eq:local-time-step}).
% I think this would affect the time step to the same extent everywhere, so I don't get why it would impact LTS more than GTS. There may be another effect occurring here.
Adjustments to the cell edge lengths $l_x$ and $l_y$ show that \gls{rtr} increases with cell size.
The cell area and perimeter have a direct effect on the local time step (\autoref{eq:local-time-step}): 
With square cells ($l_x = l_y$), 
$\Delta t_i$ is proportional to $l_x$.
While this holds true for \gls{gts} as well,
the \gls{rtr} results indicate that the cell size disproportionately affects \gls{lts}. 
The same effect can be observed for the Courant number, which is likewise proportional to $\Delta t_i$.

Decreasing the downstream water depth from \SI{1}{\meter} to \SI{0.1}{\meter} had the largest impact on the achievable reduction, which now reached $>\SI{30}{\percent}$. 
However, setting $d_{\text{downstream}} = \SI{0.0}{\meter}$, i.e., changing the simulation case to a dry dam break, leads to a lower reduction.
In \autoref{eq:cfl}, $v_{i,\max}$ decreases with $d_i$, increasing $\Delta t_i$ in turn.
As only the downstream region's water depth is varied, local time steps of upstream cells remain the same.
This causes large differences between those regions, resulting in a large number of scalar computations in the downstream region and therefore large runtime-reduction of the simulations using \gls{lts}.
However, \gls{hms} can recognize dry cells and skip flux computations for these, which explains why \gls{lts}-reductions are lower in the dry dam break case.

Disabling the bed friction term, despite reducing overall runtime, did not have a notable impact on the \gls{rtr}.

The effect of decreasing the downstream water depth is shown in \autoref{fig:heatmaps-bench-fo} for first-order reconstruction.
In both configurations, cells were updated 18 times.
\hypertarget{scalar-update-perc}{%
On average, each cell received 2.8 scalar flux updates 
(\SI{15.7}{\percent} of all updates) in the base configuration.
In the $d_{\text{downstream}} = \SI{0.1}{\meter}$ variant, this number increased to 7.0 (\SI{39.1}{\percent}).
}%
This behavior is consistent with the runtime reduction described above. 

The runtime reduction does not reach the \gls{ssc}, due to initialization and other processes within a block or cell update sequence, as previously shown in \textcite{crossley2003}. 
This is illustrated in \autoref{tab:time-base} and \autoref{tab:time-var10}. 
They present the time share of various tasks a solver thread processes within the time loop in absolute and relative terms.
In both cases, the absolute time spent on full flux computation decreased significantly, by \SI{15.0}{\percent} and \SI{37.1}{\percent}, respectively, which is notably close to the percentage of scalar flux updates described 
\hyperlink{scalar-update-perc}{above}.
Additionally, time spent on friction and new time step processing were reduced as well, since they are 
% not included in \autoref{alg:compute_block_scalar} either.
skipped in \autoref{alg:compute_block_scalar}.
Scalar flux computations and \gls{bfm} access are disabled when using the \gls{gts} scheme, and are thus listed with a time of \SI{0}{\second}. 
In contrast, when using \gls{lts}, access time weighs in at $\sim\! \SI{1.15}{\percent}$ in both cases, which is larger than the actual scalar flux computation, at \SI{0.23}{\percent} and \SI{0.72}{\percent}, respectively.
This indicates that accessing main memory is slower here than the vectorized multiply-add operation of a scalar flux computation.
% This might be due to memory access being slower than a relatively cheap scalar matrix product. %(?)
%Yep. The BFM doesn't fit into cache, so it's gonna be mostly in main memory. That's hundreds of cycles of pure latency, whereas a multiply-add (MAD) operation, once the data is there, takes only a couple of cycles. Of course, there will be a lot of MADs per block, that's why the numbers are closer together.
The \gls{ssc} varies depending on the number of scalar computations, whereas the \gls{bfm} access time remains constant, as it is accessed in both the full and scalar computations (\autoref{alg:compute_block_full} and \autoref{alg:compute_block_scalar}, respectively).

\subsection{Practical Case: Rainfall-Runoff in an Urban Area} \label{sec:results-moabit}

In the practical application case described in 
\autoref{sec:case-moabit}, the observable runtime reduction obtained by \gls{frozen-block-LTS} varies significantly over time, as well as by reconstruction scheme.
Therefore, it is presented here for three different simulated durations, for both first-order and \gls{tvd} reconstruction.
The durations are 
\SI{600}{\second}, \SI{1200}{\second}, and \SI{3600}{\second}.
However, 
it seems that even with a low Courant number of $\Cr = 0.3$, instabilities occur in this case when using \gls{tvd} reconstruction, 
which prevents the simulation from proceeding beyond \SI{1800}{\second}.
% it was not possible to simulate this example for more than $\SI{1800}{\second}$ using \gls{tvd} reconstruction. 
Hence, values for $t = 3600$ exist for first-order reconstruction~only.

\subsubsection{Accuracy}

\autoref{fig:moabit-1200s-lts-fo-paraview} shows the resulting water depth of the \gls{lts} simulation using first-order reconstruction and a visualization of deviations of the \gls{lts} solution from the one obtained with \gls{gts}, i.e., errors, at $t=\SI{1200}{\second}$.
Here, the \gls{sae} of the \gls{lts} solution amounts to $\sim\!\SI{3695}{\meter}$, or an average of $\SI{0.0036}{\meter}$ per cell. 
Most regions have an absolute error below $\SI{0.03}{\meter}$, i.e., are shown in light blue.
283 of 1024000 (\SI{0.028}{\percent}) cells show an absolute error greater than \SI{0.05}{\meter}, and 50 (\SI{0.0049}{\percent}) deviate more than \SI{0.10}{\meter}.
% and by far the largest absolute error is in a single cell at $\SI{0.981407}{\meter}$.
The three cells exhibiting the largest deviations differ by \SI{0.98}{\meter},  \SI{0.66}{\meter}, and \SI{0.32}{\meter}.
% These values apply to first-order reconstruction, but for \gls{tvd} reconstruction, similar errors occur, resulting in a \gls{sae} of \SI{4258.2}{\meter}.
Qualitatively, similar results are obtained with \gls{tvd} reconstruction, and thus their description is not repeated here. The respective \gls{sae} is $\sim\!\SI{4260}{\meter}$, which amounts to $\sim\!\SI{0.0042}{\meter}$ per cell.

Again, 
% the following analysis covers only first-order reconstruction, 
% as results obtained with \gls{tvd} showed large similarities.
only the results with first-order reconstruction are described here, as those obtained with \gls{tvd} are very similar in their characteristics.
Compared to \autoref{fig:moabit-1200s-lts-fo-diff}, the error regions have become more concentrated: there are fewer, but larger continuous regions. 
Again, most of them have an absolute error below $\SI{0.03}{\meter}$, just 81 of 1024000 cells (\SI{0.0079}{\percent}) show an absolute error greater than $\SI{0.05}{\meter}$,
and 13 (\SI{0.0013}{\percent}) deviate more than $\SI{0.10}{\meter}$. 
% The largest value is in a single cell at 
The three largest deviations are all $\sim\!\SI{0.23}{\meter}$.

\autoref{fig:moabit-error-plot} shows the development of the water depth's \gls{sae} of the \gls{lts} solution over time, for both first-order and \gls{tvd} reconstruction.
For both schemes, the \gls{sae} reaches a maximum value above $\SI{4000}{\meter}$ at $t=\SI{100}{\second}$, which is the first time at which results are exported, but stabilizes around $\SI{3695}{\meter}$ and $\SI{4260}{\meter}$, respectively, from $t=\SI{300}{\second}$ onward.

\subsubsection{Runtime Analysis}

\autoref{tab:real} shows the average runtime of 10 runs each for all three simulation durations, the relative difference between \gls{gts} and \gls{lts} runtimes and the \gls{ssc}.

\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption[Average runtime of 10 runs, \acrshort{rtr} and \acrshort{ssc} for the urban scenario.]
  {
    Average runtime of 10 runs, \acrfull{rtr} and \acrfull{ssc} for the urban scenario of each combination of \gls{gts}/\gls{lts} first-order/\gls{tvd} reconstruction.
  }
  \label{tab:real}
  \small
  \centering
  \input{tabs/real-tab.tex}
\end{table}

As a first observation, the \gls{gts} runtimes in \autoref{tab:real} indicate that the global time step appears to decrease over the duration of the simulation: 
While it takes $\sim\!\SI{80}{\second}$ (\SI{180}{\second} with \gls{tvd}) to simulate the first \SI{600}{\second}, the next interval of the same length takes disproportionately longer, with (rounded) $\num{357} - \num{84} = \SI{273}{\second}$ using first-order and \SI{380}{\second} using \gls{tvd} reconstruction.
For first-order reconstruction, where such data is available, this trend continues: Here, the latter two thirds of the simulation take up \SI{97}{\percent} of the runtime.

The runtime reductions achieved by \gls{lts} over \gls{gts} differ greatly between the reconstruction schemes. 
In the first \SI{600}{\second}, a reduction of just \SI{3.3}{\percent} is obtained with first-order reconstruction. However, the \gls{ssc} amounts to just \SI{0.3}{\percent}, which contradicts previous results obtained in \autoref{sec:results-accuracy-analytical} and \textcite{crossley2003}, as runtime reduction exceeds the \gls{ssc}.
By contrast, a runtime reduction of \SI{17.6}{\percent} and a \gls{ssc} of \SI{24.64}{\percent}, is achieved with \gls{tvd} in the same period.
When considering up to \SI{1200}{\second}, the runtime reduction is reduced for both schemes, to $<\SI{2}{\percent}$ and $<\SI{7}{\percent}$, respectively. 
Similarly, the \gls{ssc} decreased to \SI{18.2}{\percent} for \gls{tvd}, or \SI{7.29}{\percent} if only inner blocks are considered.
However, the last two thirds of the simulation appear to benefit much more from using \gls{lts}, as here, and with first-order reconstruction, a runtime reduction of $>\SI{22}{\percent}$ was observed.

To further investigate this behavior, heatmaps showing the \gls{ssc} per block, are provided in 
Figures \ref{fig:heatmap-moabit-600s}--\ref{fig:heatmap-moabit-3600s}, with first order on the left and \gls{tvd} on the right. 
%
For short simulations of 10 minutes (\SI{600}{\second}), the \gls{ssc} diverges, depending on the utilized reconstruction scheme.
\autoref{fig:heatmap-moabit-600s-fo} represents the low overall \gls{ssc} of the first-order scheme
at this time. It does not show any noticeable local \gls{ssc} either.
In contrast, \autoref{fig:heatmap-moabit-600s-tvd} shows notably higher values ($\sim\!10-\SI{20}{\percent}$) in a very uniform distribution of scalar flux computations across the whole domain for the \gls{tvd} reconstruction, matching the higher overall \gls{ssc}.
However, it has been observed, that \gls{tvd} boundary blocks receive more scalar flux computations than inner blocks: 
when looking at all blocks, the \gls{ssc} amounts to \SI{24.64}{\percent}, as it is obtained per block, not per cell.
On the other hand, just \SI{16.12}{\percent} of inner block updates could be carried out as scalar flux computations.
The boundary blocks, which make up \SI{21.6}{\percent} (70 out of 324) of all blocks, distort the overall \acrlong{ssc}, as their \acrshort{ssc} amounts to \SI{55.1}{\percent}.
Due to their small size, they are not noticeable in \autoref{fig:heatmap-moabit-600s-tvd}.
Thus far, no explanation could be found for the divergence between reconstruction schemes and the differing behavior of boundary blocks.

In simulations of 20 minutes (\SI{1200}{\second}), both reconstruction schemes' runtime reduction decreases in comparison to first \SI{600}{\second}.
Both heatmaps in \autoref{fig:heatmap-moabit-1200s} show largely similar distributions of \gls{ssc} values, with small regions exhibiting relatively high \gls{ssc} values of $\sim\!40-\SI{50}{\percent}$. These regions are the same for both schemes.
% Other regions around them show  slightly larger values for the \gls{tvd} scheme in comparison to the first-order scheme.
Once more, the boundary and inner blocks of the \gls{tvd} scheme diverge: 
the overall \gls{ssc} amounts to \SI{18.2}{\percent} for \gls{tvd}, 
or \SI{7.3}{\percent}, if only inner blocks are considered. In contrast, the outer blocks' value of \SI{57.6}{\percent} even exceeds the previous value at $t=\SI{600}{\second}$.
This, again, cannot be explained by current results, as increases in the \gls{ssc} should cause runtime reduction to increase in return.

Finally, when considering a full hour of simulated time,
the \gls{ssc} increases further, exceeding all previous values. 
\autoref{fig:heatmap-moabit-3600s} shows a much wider distribution of \gls{ssc} values between regions: 
Both higher \gls{ssc} per block and more blocks with high \gls{ssc} are achieved.
The vast majority of blocks exhibit a \gls{ssc} $>\SI{10}{\percent}$ and several clusters of high \gls{ssc} values can be identified.
Blocks with large \gls{ssc} values at $t=\SI{1200}{\second}$ maintain this status, 
but with increased values of $\sim\!80-\SI{90}{\percent}$ and several of these form centers of such clusters.
The increased range of local \gls{ssc} is likely due to the much more heterogeneous water depth, shown in \autoref{fig:moabit-3600s-lts-fo-d}, as it has a large impact on the size of the local time step.

\subsection{Stability}\label{sec:results-ugly}

Within the process of implementing the \gls{frozen-block-LTS} scheme, additional test cases have been run, e.g., to gain insights into stability and mass conservation of the scheme.
One of these is a variation of the \gls{1D} wet dam break used above:
free outflow was disabled at all boundaries to maintain 
the total water volume, 
and the simulation duration was extended to \SI{120}{\second}.
Mesh and block sizes were set to $400 \times 150$ and $8 \times 8$ cells, respectively.
Other parameters were adopted from the base configuration used in \autoref{sec:results-benchmarks}.
The extended duration allowed the wave to reach the downstream boundary and be reflected.
\autoref{fig:tvd-checker-boarding} shows a three-dimensional visualization of the water surface at $t=\SI{110}{\second}$ -- after the reflection of the wave, which occours at $t\sim\SI{35}{\second}$.
While the results of the first-order scheme show a smooth surface, the results of the \gls{tvd} scheme show instabilities in the form of checker-boarding.
The modification described in \autoref{sec:criterion-mod} has reduced this behavior, but it could not be fully prevented.

While providing overall good stability, there exist combinations of schemes and boundary conditions, under which the proposed \gls{lts} scheme in its current form does not reach the same level of stability as \gls{hms}' \gls{gts} scheme.
