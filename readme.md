This repository contains submodules. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.

Some visualizations were built using [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) and need to be compiled before being able to compile `main.tex`. This includes all heatmaps located in `typst/heatmaps`.

Required LaTeX packages are listed in `latex-requirements.txt`. Additionally, `biber` and `xindy` are required.
